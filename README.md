# CrPYtoLearn
My applied cryptography project

## Created using
- Python
- Flask / Jinja
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- PyCryptodome

## About Project
This was an individual project where we are tasked to create an application and implement many various common cryptographic techniques and algorithms that aims to teach the user on how they work and allow the user to play with them.

## Project Features
#### Crytographic techniques
- Shift cipher
- Mono-alphabet cipher
- Rail fence technique
- Simple columnar transposition technique
- Vernam cipher
- Diffie-Hellman key exchange

#### Symmetric Algorithms
- Electronic Code Book (ECB)
- Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)
- Cipher Feedback (CFB)
- Output Feedback (OFB)

#### Other features
- 5 chapters about data security
- Quiz system that test about the 5 chapters
